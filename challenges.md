## Shellcode

### Missing Missy

120 points

The first task Mad Programming Skillz Pty. Ltd have for you requires that you write a function in shellcode that sets the EAX register to the memory address of the first instruction of your shellcode. The code to be tested is running on the server at 172.16.1.20:9090. The server will provide more information on your task. Your test MUST return execution to the program.



### X97:L97

200 points

Mad Programming Skillz Pty. Ltd have created code to dynamically allocate a function that returns a flag, obfuscate it and place it randomly in memory to improve software security. To ensure this works correctly, they need you to write a test with shellcode that will locate the function within the specified memory range, deobfuscate and return control to it. The code is running at 172.16.1.20:16831. The server will provide more information on your task. 



### Stop, Rop and Roll

280 points

The last task that Mad Programming skills have provided requires that you test a range of functionality in a binary provided by them. The development of this binary had no thought for future testing so DEP was enabled, this means you will need to add a pivot and ROP in addition the test shellcode to return the flag. The code is running at 172.16.1.20:22523. The server will provide more information on your task.

### Jeremy's Iron

120 points

FortCerts needs you to write a program to test the functionality of a customers anagram program. Write a program that will unscramble the given word from a list of words and return it to the server. To be sure that the testing is reliable you will need to do this multiple times before the flag is revealed. The customer program is running at 172.16.1.20:5050

### Autobalanced

200 points

FortCerts is certifying a server program that generates challenges for authentication purposes. Write a program that will solve the challenges provided by the server. To ensure results are consistent and repeatable you will need to solve a number of challenges before you are authenticated and gain the flag. The server program is running at 172.16.1.20:9876



### Spelunking!

280 points

FortCerts are working on a breakthrough project known as project EVATAR. Using the EVATAR interface, players use neural brain circuit interferometry to control a real person trying to escape from a dangerous scenario. In this case, the scenario is a person stuck in a cave (with steps, apparently). Write a program to control your EVATAR to find the key and escape the maze. Watch your EVATAR's step though, the ceiling may be unstable. The project EVATAR access interface is located at 172.16.1.20:7788. Also don't tell anyone, it's super hush hush.
